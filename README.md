# Simple Banking System 

This project is part of my CS&131 Computer Programming 1 in C++ course to graduate with an AAS in Computer Science with Honors. 
To complete an Honors Contract, I created with my professor at Everett Community College, Eihab El Radie, I will create 3 projects. 
I plan to iterate each project forward, expanding the application more as the course progresses.

Project 1 is primarily a Profile Creation and Login feature. There is no data structure because we have yet to delve into file manipulation. 
Upon application execution, the user is prompted to log in, create a profile, or exit the program. All three options are implemented. However, upon login, the features virtually end. 

In my next iteration, I will utilize file manipulation to allow the user to save their profile in a file. 
Once their profile is created, they can log in, even after having exited the program. 
After logging in, I plan to give the user an array of options, 
such as viewing (fake) checking accounts and changing personal information like their password.
